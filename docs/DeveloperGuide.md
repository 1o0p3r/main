## Introduction


WhatNow is a simple task management tool that aims to make your life easier. Instead of straining to remember the tasks that you have to do or hurriedly scribbling it on a post-it, you can now use WhatNow to organize your mountain of tasks.

This guide describes the design and implementation of WhatNow. It will help you understand how WhatNow works and how you can further contribute to its development. We have organised this guide in a top-down manner so that you can understand the big picture before moving on to the more detailed sections.


## Setting up

#### Prerequisites


1. **[JDK](#jdk) `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough.

    This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8

2. **[Eclipse](#eclipse)** IDE

3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Refer to "Importing the project into Eclipse" from step 2 onwards)

4. **Buildship [Gradle](#gradle) Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace


#### Importing the project into Eclipse

0. [Fork](#fork) this [repo](#repository), and clone the fork to your computer

1. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given in the prerequisites above)

2. Click `File` > `Import`

3. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`

4. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory

5. Click `Finish`



  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.

  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the setup to finish. This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process.

  > * If Eclipse changed any settings files during the import process automatically, you can discard those changes.

## Design

### Architecture

<p align="center">

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br>

Figure 1: The Architecture Diagram <br>

</p>

Figure 1 explains the high-level design of WhatNow. Below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/whatnow/MainApp.java). It is responsible for:

* Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them up with each other at launch of the application.

* Shutting down the components and invoking cleanup method when necessary at shutdown.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level:

* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained)) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design).

* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : The UI of that App.

* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : The command executor.

* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : The component that holds the data of the App in-memory.

* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : The component that read data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.

* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

<p align="center">

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

Figure 2: The Logic component.

</p>

Figure 2 shows an example of how a component (the `Logic` component) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

<p align="center">

<img src="images\SDforDeleteTask.png" width="800"><br>
Figure 3: Interaction of components for the LogicManager.java command
</p>

Figure 3 shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the delete todo 1 command.

> Note how the Model simply raises a WhatNowChangedEvent when the What Now data are changed, instead of asking the Storage to save the updates to the hard disk.

<p align="center">

<img src="images\SDforDeleteTaskEventHandling.png" width="800"> <br>

Figure 4: Interaction of EventsCentre with UI and Storage when a WhatNowChangedEvent is posted

</p>

Figure 4 shows how the EventsCentre reacts to the WhatNowChangedEvent which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the ‘Last Updated’ time.

> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below gives more details of each component.

### UI component

<p align="center">

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

Figure 5: The UI component.

</p>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/whatnow/ui/Ui.java)

The `UI` consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g. `CommandBox`, `FeedbackDisplay`, `TodoTaskPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `ScheduleListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, are inherited from the abstract `UiPart` class and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.

For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/whatnow/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.

* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.

* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

### Logic component

<p align="center">

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

Figure 6: The Logic component.<br>

</p>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/whatnow/logic/Logic.java)

Logic uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events. The result of the command execution is then encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object and passed back to the UI.

### Model component

<p align="center">

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

Figure 9: The Model component.

</p>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/whatnow/model/Model.java)

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.

* stores the WhatNow data.

* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

* depends on none of the other three components

### Storage component

<p align="center">

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

Figure 10: The Storage component.

</p>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/whatnow/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component:

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.

* can save the WhatNow data in xml format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.whatnow.commons` package.

## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations. The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See [Configuration](#configuration)). The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level. Currently log messages are output through `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application

* `WARNING` : Potential problem detected, proceed with caution.

* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App

* `FINE` : Details that are not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging

  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

## Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

**In Eclipse**:

> If you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later), enable assertions in JUnit tests as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option).

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run as` > `JUnit Test`

* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose to run as a JUnit test.

**Using Gradle**:

* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

We have two types of tests:

1. **[GUI](#gui) Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `guitests` package.

2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests that do not involve the GUI. They include:

   1. _Integration tests_ that checks the integration of multiple code units

     (those code units are assumed to be working).

      e.g. `seedu.whatnow.storage.StorageManagerTest`

   2. Hybrid of unit and integration tests. These tests check the correctness of the multiple  code units as well as how they are connected together.

      e.g. `seedu.whatnow.logic.LogicManagerTest`

**Headless GUI Testing** :

Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library used, our GUI tests are able to run in the headless mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. This means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.

## Dev Ops

### Build Automation

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

### Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).

 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`

 2. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) 

    and upload the JAR file you created.

### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, WhatNow depends on the

[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives of:

a. Including those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)

b. Requiring developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

## Appendix A : User Stories

Priorities: High (must have) - `* * *`, Medium (nice to have)  - `* *`,  Low (unlikely to have) - `*` <br>
